* 5.5 Defining New Foreign Object Types

The “foreign object type” facility is Guile's mechanism for importing
object and types from C or other languages into Guile's system.  If you
have a C ‘struct foo’ type, for example, you can define a corresponding
Guile foreign object type that allows Scheme code to handle ‘struct foo
*’ objects.


Can i just shadow define with define-with-documentation in my C Guile program ?
